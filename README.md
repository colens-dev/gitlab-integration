GitLab Merge Requests is a MacOS menu bar app that shows number of opened MRs (owned and assigned as a reviewer) and enables quick navigation to specific MR on GitLab.

### Motivation

- We work daily on multiple projects on GitLab ü¶ä, since we use merge request (MR) mechanism and we want to iterate quickly sometimes we have multiple opened MRs of our own and a few on which we are assigned as reviewers, when that happens there is some chance we will forget about an active MR which would prolong the task. Since we work on MacOS we thought that making a simple menu bar app would be a good way of solving that issue.

üåü¬†Look how beautiful it is¬†üòç

## Installing

Currently only mannual installation is supported and have in mind that the app is not verified by Apple so some additional steps are required.

Steps:
- Download `release.zip` file from the latest [release](https://github.com/colens-dev/macos-gitlab/releases)
- Extract files from the `.zip` archive
- Move extracted file to your Applications folder
- Hold Control, click on the application file and once the menu popup is shown click on `Open`
- Now alert popup should appear
- If you see the option to open the application go ahead and open it üéâ
- In case you didn't get the option to open the application in the first try click on `Cancel`
    - Hold control and click on the app again, choose `Open` and a new alert should appear with the option to open the application üéâ
- After getting the app to open once, you shouldn't have any more problems in the future. Please refer to [Apple's documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) for further reference

### **Launch on startup**

If you want to have this app active all the time you should configure your OS to launch this app on startup, if not have in mind that after every system restart you would need start the app manually.

For setting up launch on startup check this¬†[guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-items-automatically-when-you-log-in-mh15189/mac)
